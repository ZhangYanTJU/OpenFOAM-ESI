Description
    Transient solver for the coupled transport of a single kinematic particle
    cloud including the effect of the volume fraction of particles on the
    continuous phase. Multi-Phase Particle In Cell (MPPIC) modeling is used to
    represent collisions without resolving particle-particle interactions.
