Test for momentum wall functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computes a series of steady boundary layer calculations, varying the Reynolds
number. Wall u+ plotted as a function of log10(y+), and compared with wall
profile given by Spalding's law.


Usage:

- run test using Allrun script
- uses foamLog to generate u+ and y+ values
- plots are generated using gnuplot, and can be found under plots directory
