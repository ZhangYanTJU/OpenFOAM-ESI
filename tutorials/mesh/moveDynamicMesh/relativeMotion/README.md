Testcase demonstrating combining solid body motion solver
with a Laplacian mesh distortion solver.

There is a outer cylinder, spinning with a constant rpm. Inside
this a smaller cylinder counter-spins (so with constant but opposite
rpm). Finally inside this smaller cylinder there is relative motion
between two blocks (using boundary conditions and a mesh distortion solver).
